## Project Overview

The Oak Park Community Center serves over 5,000 residents annually with after-school programs, senior services, and community events. Rising energy costs were cutting into program budgets, threatening services to the community. This solar retrofit transformed the 40-year-old facility into a model of sustainability while providing educational opportunities for local youth.

## Community Impact

The community center provides essential services including:
- After-school tutoring and homework help
- Senior lunch programs and activities
- Job training and computer literacy classes
- Community meetings and cultural events
- Youth sports and recreation programs

## Installation Details

We designed a cost-effective 25 kW system optimized for the building's energy profile:

- **74 high-efficiency solar panels** producing 38,000 kWh annually
- **String inverters** for simple, reliable operation
- **Educational display** in the lobby showing real-time production
- **LED lighting upgrade** to maximize solar benefits
- **Smart thermostat integration** for energy optimization
