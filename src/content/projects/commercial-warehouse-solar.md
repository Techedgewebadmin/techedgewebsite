## Project Overview

Pacific Logistics Inc., a 45,000 sq ft distribution center in San Diego, needed a solution to combat rising energy costs. Their daytime operations were perfect for solar, with peak energy usage aligning with peak solar production.

## Business Challenge

With energy costs exceeding $18,000 monthly and increasing annually, Pacific Logistics was looking for ways to reduce operational expenses without disrupting their 24/7 logistics operations. The warehouse's large, flat roof presented an ideal opportunity for solar.

## Installation Details

We designed and installed a 85 kW commercial solar array using:

- **238 high-efficiency panels** rated at 360W each
- **SolarEdge commercial inverters** with power optimizers
- **Non-penetrating ballasted racking** to preserve roof warranty
- **Remote monitoring system** with predictive maintenance alerts
- **Emergency shutdown system** for safety compliance

## Technical Specifications

### System Components
- **Panels:** 238x Trina Solar Vertex S+ (360W, bifacial)
- **Inverters:** 3x SolarEdge SE27.6K commercial inverters
- **Power Optimizers:** SolarEdge P850 optimizers
- **Mounting:** Unirac RM10 ballasted racking system
- **Monitoring:** SolarEdge commercial monitoring platform
- **Safety:** Rapid shutdown system per NEC 2020

### Roof Loading & Engineering
- **Total System Weight:** 4.2 lbs/sq ft (within roof capacity)
- **Wind Rating:** Designed for 140 mph wind loads
- **Seismic Compliance:** Zone 4 seismic design
- **Tilt Angle:** 10° for optimal year-round production

## Installation Timeline

The project was completed in 3 weeks with zero operational downtime:

**Week 1:** Site preparation, delivery, and staging  
**Week 2:** Racking installation (nights/weekends)  
**Week 3:** Panel installation and electrical work  
**Final Week:** Testing, commissioning, and PTO

All work was performed during off-peak hours to avoid disrupting warehouse operations.
