## Project Overview

This stunning eco-home installation showcases the perfect blend of sustainability and modern design. The Martinez family wanted to achieve energy independence while maintaining the architectural integrity of their contemporary home in the heart of Los Angeles.

## Installation Details

Our team installed 36 high-efficiency monocrystalline solar panels with a combined capacity of 12 kW. The system includes:

- **Tesla Powerwall 2** for energy storage (13.5 kWh capacity)
- **Enphase IQ8+ microinverters** for maximum efficiency and panel-level monitoring
- **Smart monitoring system** accessible via mobile app with real-time production data
- **Integrated EV charging** infrastructure ready for future electric vehicles
- **Premium black-on-black panels** for seamless roof integration

## Technical Specifications

### System Components
- **Panels:** 36x Canadian Solar HiKu6 Mono PERC (335W each)
- **Inverters:** Enphase IQ8+ microinverters (366W each)
- **Battery:** Tesla Powerwall 2 (13.5 kWh usable capacity)
- **Mounting:** IronRidge XR100 railing system with flashings
- **Monitoring:** Enphase Enlighten web and mobile app

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Daily Production:** 46 kWh
- **Peak Production:** 11.8 kW (sunny days)
- **System Efficiency:** 96.2%
- **First Year Degradation:** <2%

## Installation Process

The installation was completed over 5 days with minimal disruption to the family:

**Day 1-2:** Roof preparation and mounting rail installation  
**Day 3:** Solar panel installation and wiring  
**Day 4:** Inverter and Powerwall installation  
**Day 5:** System testing, inspection, and activation

## Results & Impact

The system generates approximately 16,800 kWh annually, covering 95% of the family's energy needs. With California's net metering program (NEM 3.0), they're selling excess energy back to the grid during peak production hours.

### Financial Benefits
- **Monthly Savings:** $200+ on electricity bills
- **Annual Savings:** $2,400+
- **30-Year Savings:** $72,000+ (with inflation adjustment)
- **ROI:** Expected payback in 6-7 years
- **Property Value Increase:** Estimated $24,000+

### Environmental Impact
- **CO2 Reduction:** 8.5 tons annually (equivalent to planting 200 trees)
- **Gasoline Equivalent:** Avoiding 950 gallons of gas consumption per year
- **Energy Independence:** 95% self-sufficient
- **Grid Relief:** Reducing strain during peak demand hours

## Smart Home Integration

The system seamlessly integrates with the home's existing automation:
- Automated energy management based on time-of-use rates
- Real-time monitoring and alerts via smartphone
- Automatic load shifting to maximize battery usage
- Weather-based charging optimization

## Client Testimonial
